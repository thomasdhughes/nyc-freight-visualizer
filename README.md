Live at https://thomasinch.github.io/nyc-freight-visualizer/

How it works and why I made it: https://infrastructure.bearblog.dev/steel-arteries/

Built off the data from this paper: https://cip.tandoncsmart.com/uploads/1694025758042-Chow_CityTruckRouteNetwork_2023.pdf

And the NYC neighborhood boundaries from NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2020-Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTAs-/9nt8-h7nd/about_data

Data refined in this notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e8tK4bFbaPH_dLI_LDpsyDySj9ikLQv-?usp=sharing
